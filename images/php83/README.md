# PHP 8.3

Docker image for [PHP-FPM] version 8.3.

Built from [libops/isle-buildkit php83](https://github.com/libops/buildkit/tree/main/images/php83)

Acts as the PHP-FPM base Docker image for PHP based services. The Nginx image
extends this image to provide the web server layer.

## Dependencies

Requires `libops/base` Docker image to build. Please refer to the
[Base Image README](../base/README.md) for additional information.

## Settings

> N.B. For all of the settings below images that descend from
> `libops/php` will apply prefix to every setting. So for example
> `PHP_LOG_LEVEL` would become `DRUPAL_PHP_LOG_LEVEL` this is to allow for
> different settings on a per-service basis.
